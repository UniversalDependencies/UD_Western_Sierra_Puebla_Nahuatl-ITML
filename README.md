# Summary



UD Western Sierra Puebla Nahuatl-IU is a treebank consisting of sentences from written fiction and non-fiction, spontaenous speech, and grammar examples.

# Introduction

The treebank was pre-annotated for morphology using the [`apertium-nhi`](https://github.com/apertium/apertium-nhi/) (Pugh et al, 2021).
The morphological analyses were disambiguated and annotated for dependency structure by hand.
